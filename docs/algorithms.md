# Algorithms

## Sorting

- Quick sort:
- Heap sort: Convert to a heap, then keep popping values out of the heap.
- Merge sort: Keep splitting the input in half, look in left and right and decide where each goes.
- Insertion sort: consider the next item, keep swapping it left until the next left value is less than it.
- Bubble sort: repeatedly swap consecutive values.
- Hybrid
- Selection sort: find the smallest in what remains, and swap it with the next one.

# Data Structures

- Stacks
- Queues
- Heap
- Binary search
- Binary trees: holds value, left node, and right node.
- Graphs
- Breadth first search: requires using a queue
- Hashing
- Distributed Sets
- String searching
- Trie
- Splay Tree
